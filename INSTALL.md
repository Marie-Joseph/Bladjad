## Installing on FreeBSD

### Requirements
First you'll need to get ahold of the binary for Bladjad. The .tar.xz file made
availble on itch.io or the GitHub release pages should have everything you'll
need. If you're compiling from source, check [COMPILE.md](COMPILE.md).

### Commands
Quite straightforwardly, simply run `sh install.sh` in this directory to install
Bladjad in /usr/local. If you'd rather install it somewhere else, simply change
`$PREFIX` in [install.sh](install.sh).
