## Compiling Bladjad on FreeBSD

### Requirements
Check [README.md](README.md) for general project requirements. The compilation
instructions there should apply on FreeBSD as well; if you run
into any problems, please report them.

### Commands
Once you have the requisite dependencies and tools, simply run
`dub build --build=release`.
